### Purpose

This repo cache scripts dealing with endnote20 in MacOS. 

### Detail

**label_manage.py**: Rename labels in Endnote20, to export a well-labeled .bib file, and enjoy citing them while writing! Managed label may look like ${author}_%{year}, or any other type. You can easily adjust it.

This script now only tested in MacOS.Origin script comes from Bill Seufzer, NASA.
You can see orig script in https://community.endnote.com/t/scripting-endnote/260221
Thx for Bill's sharing!

NOTE: this script will only handle the current endnote GROUP you open. If not open any endnote window, an error will raise.
